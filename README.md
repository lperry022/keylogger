## 🔍 Project Description

This simple keylogger logs keystrokes in the background and writes them to a local file. The goal was to understand:

- How Python can be used to monitor keyboard events
- How to hide a Python script using `.pyw` to avoid opening a terminal window
- How to launch the script with a `.bat` file
- How to create a shortcut to execute the logger
